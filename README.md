# Inspiration
As young adults, our inspiration for the Inflation Insights app is rooted in the vision of financial inclusion for everyone. We are dedicated to empowering students with essential financial knowledge and providing tailored guidance for older individuals, ensuring accessibility through a user-friendly design.

# What it does
Inflation Insights is a mobile app that branches off of 'Sun Life Financial'. It consults and guides users about the impact of inflation on different sectors in life (Student, Retirement, Mortgage). Plus, it serves to aid users on how to better manage their finances, improve their investments and help face the challenges cause by inflation.

# Key Features
Photo to Text
Expense Tracking The "Photo to Text" feature revolutionizes expense tracking by allowing users to effortlessly upload images of their bills, enabling users to add these expenses to the "Expense Tracking" feature. This feature allows users to set financial goals and track their expenses.

## Expense Estimation Calculators 
The calculators assist users in estimating the total yearly expenses associated with pursuing higher education ( tuition, textbooks, accommodation) and annual expenses during retirement, as well as estimating monthly mortgage payments when purchasing a home.

## Login/Sign Up User Authentication 
The "Login/Sign Up User Authentication" ensures a secure and personalized experience for users. Through secure authentication, users can access their financial data, track their progress, and benefit from personalized features within the app.

## Test Your Knowledge Quiz 
The "Test Your Knowledge Quiz" engages users in a dynamic and educational experience. Focused on inflation and its impacts, the quiz assesses users' understanding of essential financial concepts. This feature not only serves as a learning tool but also adds an interactive and enjoyable element to the app, encouraging continuous financial education.

## Investment Options 
The "Investment Options" feature provides users with insights into various investment avenues, including Tax-Free Savings Accounts (TFSA), Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSPs), stocks, ETFs, and more. Users can explore these options and receive guidance on investment strategies.
